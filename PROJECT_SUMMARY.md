- ✅ Booking class with lifecycle management
- ✅ Statistics class for analytics and reporting

### 4. Business Logic Controllers
- ✅ AuthController: User authentication and management
- ✅ CourtController: Court CRUD operations
- ✅ BookingController: Booking operations and validation
- ✅ Notification system integration

### 5. GUI Framework Setup
- ✅ wxWidgets integration

## Design Patterns đã áp dụng

### 1. Singleton Pattern
- **Class**: BookingManager
- **Purpose**: Centralized booking management
- **Benefits**: Thread-safe, single point of access, global state management

### 2. Observer Pattern
- **Classes**: NotificationObserver hierarchy
- **Purpose**: Automatic notifications on booking events
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, extensible notification system

## Lưu ý kỹ thuật (Technical Notes)

### Performance
- Thread-safe implementation using std::mutex
- Efficient algorithms for conflict detection
- Smart pointers for memory management

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Input validation (partially implemented)
- Password hashing (needs proper implementation for production)

### Extensibility
- Interface-based design
- Pluggable notification system
- Modular architecture

## Đóng góp (Contributing)

The project follows OOP principles and uses modern C++ features:
- C++17 standard
- Smart pointers for memory management
- STL containers and algorithms
- Exception handling
- RAII principles

This is a comprehensive foundation for a badminton court management system with room for extensive customization and enhancement.
