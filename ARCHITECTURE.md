# Badminton Court Management System - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

### Design Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Singleton Pattern - BookingManager
- **Purpose**: Centralized management of all booking operations
- **Implementation**: Thread-safe singleton with mutex protection
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create, modify, and cancel bookings
  - Check court availability and conflicts
  - Manage booking lifecycle
  - Coordinate with notification system

#### 2. Observer Pattern - Notification System
- **Purpose**: Automatic notifications when booking events occur
- **Implementation**: Multiple observer types for different notification channels
- **Observer Types**:
  - EmailNotificationObserver: Email notifications
  - SMSNotificationObserver: SMS notifications (extensible)
  - InAppNotificationObserver: In-application notifications

### Core Components

#### Models (Data Layer)
- **User**: User authentication and profile management
- **Court**: Court information and status management
- **Booking**: Booking details and lifecycle management
- **Statistics**: Data analytics and reporting

#### Controllers (Business Logic Layer)
- **AuthController**: User authentication and authorization
- **CourtController**: Court management operations
- **BookingController**: Booking operations and validation
- **NotificationController**: Notification management
- **StatisticsController**: Analytics and reporting

#### Views (Presentation Layer)
- **LoginFrame**: User authentication interface
- **MainFrame**: Main application window with navigation
- **CourtManagementPanel**: Court CRUD operations (admin)
- **BookingPanel**: Booking interface (customer)
- **StatisticsPanel**: Analytics dashboard

### Class Relationships

```

### Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   LoginFrame → AuthController → User validation → MainFrame

2. **Booking Creation**:
   BookingPanel → BookingController → BookingManager → Notification System

3. **Court Management**:
   CourtManagementPanel → CourtController → Court CRUD operations

4. **Statistics Generation**:
   StatisticsPanel → StatisticsController → Data aggregation → Report generation

### Key Features Implementation

#### User Management
- Role-based access control (Admin/Customer)
- Secure authentication (password hashing in production)
- User profile management

#### Court Management
- CRUD operations for courts
- Status management (Available/Maintenance/Out of Service)
- Rate management

#### Booking System
- Conflict detection algorithm
- Availability checking
- Time slot validation
- Cost calculation

#### Notification System
- Event-driven notifications
- Multiple notification channels
- Configurable notification preferences

#### Statistics and Reporting
- Real-time analytics
- Revenue tracking
- Usage statistics
- Export capabilities (CSV, reports)

### GUI Architecture

#### Framework: wxWidgets
- Cross-platform GUI toolkit
- Native look and feel
- Comprehensive widget set

#### Layout Management
- Sizer-based layouts for responsive design
- Panel-based organization
- Notebook control for tabbed interface

#### Event Handling
- Event-driven programming model
- Command pattern for user actions
- Signal/slot mechanism for component communication

### Error Handling

#### Validation Layers
1. **Input Validation**: UI-level validation for user inputs
2. **Business Logic Validation**: Controller-level business rules
3. **Data Validation**: Model-level data integrity checks

#### Error Recovery
- Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Transaction rollback for data consistency
- Logging for debugging and auditing

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication
- Password hashing (production implementation needed)
- Session management
- Role-based access control

#### Data Protection
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (when database is implemented)
- Secure data storage

### Extensibility

#### Design for Extension
- Interface-based programming
- Plugin architecture for notifications
- Configurable business rules
- Modular component design

#### Future Enhancements
- Database integration (SQLite/MySQL)
- Web-based interface
- Mobile application
- Payment processing
- Advanced reporting
- Multi-language support

### Performance Considerations

#### Memory Management
- Smart pointers for automatic memory management
- Resource cleanup in destructors
- Efficient data structures

#### Scalability
- Efficient algorithms for conflict detection
- Indexed data access patterns
- Lazy loading for large datasets

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Controller logic testing
- Model validation testing
- Algorithm correctness testing

#### Integration Testing
- Component interaction testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- GUI functionality testing

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Role-based scenario testing
- Usability testing
- Performance testing
